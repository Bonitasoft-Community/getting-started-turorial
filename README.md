# Getting started: workspace and .bos file

If you follow the [Bonita getting started](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita//_getting-started-tutorial) you should end up with a workspace just like the content of this Git repository.

You can get the .bos file from the [release section on GitHub](/bonitasoft-community/getting-started-tutorial/releases/latest) and import it in your Studio (note that it will overwrite what you create in your current workspace on Community Edition).
Alternatively you can clone this repository in Enterprise Edition using Git integration.
